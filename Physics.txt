Did Albert Einstein steal the idea for the relativity theory? There are rumors that various scientists published the basic ideas of the relativity theory earlier and Einstein did not cite them at all in his publications. Is this true?
How do I become as intelligent as Richard Feynman?
If space is a vacuum, then why doesn't it suck in all the air from Earth's atmosphere?
Can you be shot from so far away that the bullet loses enough energy and the shot does not break skin and just hurts?
Why are we using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, when the EPR paradox has proved it wrong?
Who is the greatest self taught physicist or mathematician?
Why is it that when disarming a bomb, that you don't just cut all the wires at once?
How long would humans survive if the sun disappeared?
Can you blow my mind with a space fact?
Has there ever been a question asked by a small child that no scientist ever thought to ask, that led to a profound discovery?
